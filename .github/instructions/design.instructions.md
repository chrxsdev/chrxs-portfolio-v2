## Non-generic design instruction

Completely avoid generic styles, typical templates, and default purple/blue palettes. Design a visually striking, different, and memorable interface with a clear, coherent identity.

- Propose an original color palette, far from the typical #6366F1 / #7C3AED / #4F46E5 and similar tones. You can use contrasting combinations, unusual gradients, or uncommon monochrome schemes, but always ensure readability.
- Use typography that matches the concept, avoiding the generic corporate dashboard look. Suggest at least 2 font families (headings + body) and briefly justify their style.
- If is an existing project, ask if want to change the color palette, typography, or visual style. If not, proceed with the same color palette, typography, and visual style.
- Define a distinct visual style (for example: brutalist, neomorphic, minimal with strong accents, retro-futuristic, editorial, etc.) and apply it consistently to buttons, cards, forms, icons, and layouts.
- Structure the interface with non-trivial layouts, avoiding the typical left purple sidebar + simple header pattern. Use asymmetric compositions, color-blocked sections, well-considered whitespace, and a clear visual hierarchy.
- Add micro-interaction details (hover states, active states, transitions) that reinforce the design’s personality.
- Always respond by explicitly describing the color palette (with hex codes), typography, key components, and the overall visual concept so that the result looks unique and clearly different from standard UI templates.
